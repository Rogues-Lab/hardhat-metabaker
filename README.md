# Hardhat Metabaker plugin

This is a Hardhat plugin that is used for publishing metadata to web3 storage.

We supply tasks to aid in the Metadata storage:

- Generate example metadata
- Batch metadata uploads (supporting reveals)
- Bake a projects metadata, reads contract and web3 pushes metadata.

https://nft.storage/ is used as the web3 storage.

## Installation

To use this plugins

```bash
npm install @rogueslab/hardhat-metabaker
```

Extend your hardhat.config and supply the `nft.storage` API key:

in JavaScript (`hardhat.config.js`):
```javascript
require("@rogueslab/hardhat-metabaker");

const config = {
  // solidity etc
  metabaker: {
    nftStorageKey: "your nft.storage API key here, ideally loaded from .env",
    imageExtension: "jpg",
    baseMetadataPath: "./metadata"
  }
}

```

in TypeScript (`hardhat.config.ts`):

```typescript
import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/types";
import "@rogueslab/hardhat-metabaker";

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  // solidity etc
  metabaker: {
    nftStorageKey: "your nft.storage API key here, ideally loaded from .env",
    imageExtension: "jpg",
    baseMetadataPath: "./metadata"
  }
}

```

## Plugin development

Make sure to read our [Plugin Development Guide](https://hardhat.org/advanced/building-plugins.html) to learn how to build a plugin.

## Testing

Running `npm run test` will run every test located in the `test/` folder. They
use [mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/),
but you can customize them.

We recommend creating unit tests for your own modules, and integration tests for
the interaction of the plugin with Hardhat and its dependencies.

## Linting and autoformat

All of Hardhat projects use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and
[tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/).

You can check if your code style is correct by running `npm run lint`, and fix
it with `npm run lint:fix`.

## Building the project

Just run `npm run build` Ô∏èüë∑



## How to package up code 
`npm pack` can be used to package up the library.

`"hardhat-metabaker-0.0.1.tgz"` will be generated


## using this lib before NPM publish
(recommend deleting from node_module before reinstalling)

We need to add the plugin into the packages.json of the hardhard project that we are used in.
    `"hardhat-metabaker": "file:../../../../../rogues/hardhat-metabaker/hardhat-metabaker-0.0.1.tgz"`

Then install (with npm install / yarn install), this will copy the files into the local node_modules

## Hardhat Config
`hardhat.config.ts` we need to add `import "hardhat-metabaker";`

## Testing it
Once it is installed and config added.

```bash
npm or yarn run hardhat
```

We should now see the new tasks in hardhat output, like below:

```bash
AVAILABLE TASKS:

  accounts                   Prints the list of accounts
  check                      Check whatever you need
  clean                      Clears the cache and deletes all artifacts
  downloadMintedData         Collects Metadata into local folder for processing
